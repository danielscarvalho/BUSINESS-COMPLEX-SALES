References about business and complex sales for computer science and engineering

Selling softwares and IT projects is hard, it is complex sales.

Pre-sales engineering is required in order to define resources (people, telecom and network, security, solftware and hardware), time and investiment. 

## Pre-sales engineering tools:

- Design Sprint - Design Thinking (prototyping)
- PMI - Preliminary project design (High-Level Gantt Chart and/or WBS - Work breakdown structure)
- BPMN - Business Process Model and Notation
- ERM - Entityâ€“relationship model
- System Architecture Diagram

Pre-sales engineering is high cost. It can be an initial design, scope, and requirement-gathering project.
